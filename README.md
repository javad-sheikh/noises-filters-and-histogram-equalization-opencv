First Computer Vision Homework on different noised and filters and histogram equalization effect
In this project, we add noises like gaussian noise, exponential noise, and salt and pepper noise to an image to illustrate these noises' effects on image quality.
We tested different filters like mean, median, and gaussian blur filters on the noised images we created in the last part.
We also tested the histogram equalization method on a second image, and the results were astounding.
